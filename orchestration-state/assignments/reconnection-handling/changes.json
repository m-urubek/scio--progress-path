  "summary": "Implemented connection drop and reconnection handling for Blazor Server (REQ-RT-002 through REQ-RT-005):\n\n1. Created reconnection.js - JavaScript interop that monitors Blazor's built-in reconnection UI (components-reconnect-modal) and notifies the Blazor component via DotNetObjectReference callbacks for state changes (Reconnecting, Reconnected, Disconnected).\n\n2. Created ReconnectionOverlay.razor - A full-screen overlay component that displays when connection is lost:\n   - Shows spinner with \"Connection lost. Reconnecting...\" message when reconnecting\n   - Shows checkmark with \"Reconnected!\" briefly (2 seconds) when connection is restored\n   - Shows warning icon with \"Connection lost. Please refresh the page.\" and refresh button if reconnection fails\n   - Uses theme styling with glow effects, z-index 100 to appear above all content\n\n3. Added CSS styles for the overlay to app.css - Includes fade-in animation, backdrop blur, themed colors (teal for reconnecting, purple for reconnected, pink for disconnected), and proper positioning.\n\n4. Modified App.razor - Added ReconnectionOverlay component in body (before Routes) and included reconnection.js script reference.\n\n5. Enhanced StudentChat.razor - Added hubConnection.Reconnecting and hubConnection.Closed event handlers, improved Reconnected handler to clear error messages and log restoration details.\n\n6. Enhanced GroupDashboard.razor - Added similar reconnection event handlers, re-joins group channel on reconnect, refreshes sessions and alerts from database, and rebuilds the session alerts map.\n\nStudents cannot send messages while disconnected (inherent to Blazor Server architecture - REQ-RT-005). Chat history is restored from the server upon reconnection (REQ-RT-003).",
