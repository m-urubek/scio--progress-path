  "summary": "Implemented Docker Compose development environment with hot-reload support per REQ-DEPLOY-016 through REQ-DEPLOY-021:\n\n1. **docker-compose.yml**: Updated app service to target new 'development' stage in Dockerfile, added volume mount for hot-reload (./ProgressPath:/src:cached), added dotnet watch command, added DOTNET_USE_POLLING_FILE_WATCHER and DOTNET_WATCH_RESTART_ON_RUDE_EDIT environment variables, updated port mapping to 5000:5000.\n\n2. **Dockerfile**: Added new 'development' stage with SDK image, Node.js, and environment variables for hot-reload. Updated build stage COPY paths to match new build context (root instead of ProgressPath). Production stages preserved with proper paths.\n\n3. **.env.example**: Added comprehensive naming convention documentation explaining double-underscore format maps to .NET configuration hierarchy (e.g., LLM__Provider -> LLM:Provider), and mapped PRD variable names to .NET format.\n\n4. **.dockerignore**: Enhanced with comprehensive patterns for build context, added state/ directory, improved comments explaining usage.\n\n5. Verified .gitignore already has .env entry (REQ-DEPLOY-021 satisfied).\n\n6. Deleted duplicate ProgressPath/.dockerignore since build context is at root level.",
  "deviations": [
    "Created a .dockerignore in ProgressPath/ initially, then deleted it after realizing the build context is at root level - the root .dockerignore already existed and was enhanced instead",
    "The microplan step 4 suggested creating a development stage that 'Installs Node.js for Tailwind CSS watching' - implemented this as just Node.js installation since npm/Tailwind would come from the volume mount rather than being baked into the image"
