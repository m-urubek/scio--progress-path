  "considerations": [
    "The hot-reload setup requires using the SDK image (not runtime) because dotnet watch needs the SDK tools to rebuild on file changes",
    "Volume mounting the source code means the Dockerfile's COPY steps are effectively bypassed during development - the mounted volume takes precedence",
    "For hot-reload in Docker, dotnet watch run is the correct approach but may require enabling polling for file changes (DOTNET_USE_POLLING_FILE_WATCHER=1) on some systems",
    "The development stage in Dockerfile should not include the npm install/build steps since those are done via the volume mount where node_modules already exists on the host",
    "Port 5000 should be used consistently for development (the production Dockerfile uses port 80, but development convention is 5000)",
    "The .NET double-underscore convention (LLM__Provider) is required for environment variable configuration binding in ASP.NET Core - this maps to LLM:Provider in the configuration hierarchy",
    "Consider adding DOTNET_WATCH_RESTART_ON_RUDE_EDIT=true to allow watch to handle changes that require full restart",
    "The Tailwind CSS build for hot-reload may need npm run watch:css running in parallel or the css needs to be pre-built - consider adding this to the development workflow documentation"
