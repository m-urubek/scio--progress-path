  "summary": "Implemented the student group joining experience via QR code. Created JoinGroup.razor page with route /join/{JoinCode} that handles: loading state, group not found, group not confirmed, existing session restoration, and join form display. Created JoinForm.razor component with nickname input, validation, glow-button styling, and loading state. Added device.js script to App.razor for JS interop. Added Student namespace to _Imports.razor. Added CSS styles for join page icons (error, wait, success variants). The page uses OnAfterRenderAsync for JS interop (device ID from localStorage) and implements all requirements: REQ-GROUP-014 (no auth required via [AllowAnonymous]), REQ-GROUP-015 (nickname input), REQ-GROUP-016 (nickname uniqueness validation via ArgumentException), REQ-GROUP-017 (device binding), REQ-GROUP-018 (session restoration with continue button), and REQ-GROUP-010 (only confirmed groups joinable).",
