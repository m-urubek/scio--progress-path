  "summary": "Configured Tailwind CSS v4 with TherapistTemplate-inspired theme for Progress Path. Created package.json with Tailwind v4, PostCSS, and Autoprefixer dependencies plus build/watch scripts. Created app.src.css as the Tailwind source file using v4's CSS-first @theme directive with all custom colors (primary pink #ff6b9d, secondary purple #c084fc, tertiary teal #22d3d8, accent violet #a78bfa, highlight #f0abfc, dark-bg #0f0a1a, dark-surface #1a0f2e), font families (Outfit for headings, Inter for body), glow shadow variables, and keyframe animations (glow-pulse 3s, float 6s). Updated app.css with fallback styles that work before npm install is run, including all component classes (.glow-container, .inner-card, .gradient-text, .glow-button, .animate-glow, .animate-float, .nav-link) and basic Tailwind-like utility classes. Added Google Fonts preconnect and stylesheet links in App.razor for Outfit and Inter fonts. Created postcss.config.js for PostCSS plugin configuration. Updated .csproj with MSBuild target to run npm build:css before dotnet build (conditional on node_modules existing). Added node_modules/ and package-lock.json to .gitignore.",
  "deviations": [
    "Added node_modules/ and package-lock.json to .gitignore as recommended in the microplan considerations, though this was not explicitly listed as a step.",
    "Added basic Tailwind-like utility classes (.container, .flex, .p-4, .text-center, etc.) to the fallback app.css to provide a more complete development experience before npm install, beyond what was specified in the microplan."
