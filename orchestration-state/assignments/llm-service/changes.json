  "summary": "The LLM service implementation was already complete (ILLMService, LLMService, LLMSettings, PromptTemplates, GoalInterpretation, ChatContext, ChatResponse all existed). Fixed build errors by resolving type ambiguities: (1) Changed AuthController.cs to use fully qualified ProgressPath.Services.IAuthenticationService to disambiguate from Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.IAuthenticationService, (2) Changed Program.cs to use fully qualified types for the authentication service DI registration, (3) Fixed App.razor to use RenderMode.InteractiveServer instead of InteractiveServer. Build now succeeds.",

    "Fixed Program.cs IAuthenticationService/AuthenticationService ambiguity - same type conflict as AuthController.cs but not mentioned in microplan",
    "Fixed App.razor InteractiveServer error by using fully qualified RenderMode.InteractiveServer - this was blocking the build but unrelated to LLM service scope"
