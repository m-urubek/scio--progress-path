  "summary": "Implemented animated particle background using tsparticles via JavaScript interop. Created particles.js with TherapistTemplate-matching configuration (pink/purple/teal colors, grab mode on hover at 140px, push mode on click adding 2 particles, link lines with triangles enabled). Created ParticleBackground.razor component implementing IAsyncDisposable with proper JS interop lifecycle management. Added tsparticles CDN script and particles.js to App.razor. Integrated ParticleBackground component into MainLayout.razor. Added ProgressPath.Components.Shared namespace to _Imports.razor.",
  "deviations": [
    "Skipped modifying package.json to add tsparticles dependency - as noted in the microplan considerations, a CDN approach was used instead since the project only uses Tailwind CLI for CSS processing and lacks a JavaScript bundler like Webpack or Vite. The tsparticles library is loaded via CDN in App.razor."
