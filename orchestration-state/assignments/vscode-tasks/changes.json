  "summary": "Created VS Code tasks and Azure deployment scripts following SuperSmashHoesV2 patterns. Created .vscode/tasks.json with 14 tasks: 8 Azure deployment tasks (Build for Deployment, Prepare Deployment Package, Create Zip Package, Deploy to App Service, Full Deploy, Soft Deploy, Check Quota, Restart App) and 6 Docker tasks (Start, Start Background, Stop, Stop & Clean, Logs, Rebuild). Created .vscode/settings.json with configurable progresspath.azure.appName and progresspath.azure.resourceGroup settings. Created .azure/ directory with 4 shell scripts: deploy-config.sh (centralized Azure configuration template), deploy.sh (full deployment with login check, quota check, build, stop/start, health check), soft-deploy.sh (quick deploy without stop/start), and check-quota.sh (Azure Free tier quota monitoring with jq dependency). All scripts are executable and adapted for .NET Blazor Server deployment. The .gitignore already contained entries for .azure/, deploy-package/, and deploy.zip, so no modifications were needed.",
  "deviations": [
    "Removed JSON comments from tasks.json - the initial version had JavaScript-style comments which are not valid in strict JSON. While VS Code supports JSONC (JSON with Comments), standard JSON parsers do not, so comments were removed for compatibility.",
    "Added AZURE_APP_SERVICE_PLAN variable to deploy-config.sh - the microplan mentioned using App Service Plan for quota checking but didn't include a separate variable for the plan name, which is needed for the Azure REST API quota endpoint.",
    "The microplan suggested the .azure/ directory might not be in .gitignore - verified it was already present so no modification was needed."
