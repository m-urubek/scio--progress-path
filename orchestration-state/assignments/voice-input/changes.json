  "summary": "Implemented voice dictation support for the student chat interface using the Web Speech API. Created speech.js with Web Speech API integration including feature detection, SpeechRecognition initialization, start/stop recording functions, and JS-to-Blazor callbacks for transcription results and errors. Created VoiceDictation.razor component with a microphone button that shows/hides based on browser support (REQ-CHAT-015), toggles recording state with visual indication (pink pulse animation when recording per REQ-CHAT-013), and sends transcribed text back to the parent via EventCallback. Added CSS styles for the voice button with recording pulse animation in app.css. Integrated the VoiceDictation component into ChatInput.razor, positioned between the text input and send button, with transcribed text appending to the message input field for review before sending (REQ-CHAT-014). Build succeeds with 0 errors.",
