  "summary": "Implemented the multi-step group creation flow with AI goal interpretation and confirmation. Created CreateGroup.razor page at /groups/create with a three-step flow: (1) Input form with Group Name and Goal Description fields (max 500 chars with character counter), (2) GoalConfirmation component displaying interpreted goal type (Binary/Percentage), step descriptions, welcome message preview, and Accept/Reject buttons with edit mode, (3) QRCodeDisplay component showing the generated QR code, join URL, and copy-to-clipboard functionality. Added error handling for LLMServiceException with retry options. Added CSS styles for goal-step-list, welcome-message-preview, reject-button, and character-counter classes. All components use the theme's glow-container, inner-card, and glow-button styling.",
  "deviations": [
    "Combined microplan steps 1-3 into a single CreateGroup.razor file with a Step enum to manage the multi-step flow, rather than modifying the file multiple times",
    "Combined microplan steps 4-5 into a single GoalConfirmation.razor file that includes both the display and edit functionality",
    "Combined microplan steps 6-7 into a single QRCodeDisplay.razor file that includes the clipboard JS interop",
    "Combined microplan step 8 (error handling) into the initial CreateGroup.razor implementation since error handling was integral to the component design",
    "Added System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations using directive to CreateGroup.razor to fix build errors for Required and StringLength validation attributes"
