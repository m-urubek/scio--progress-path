      "description": "The off-topic counter reset in ResolveAlertAsync is not implemented. When resolving an off-topic alert, the assignment mentions 'restart warning cycle for off-topic' but the counter is not reset on resolution. The reset only happens when an on-topic message is received via ResetOffTopicCounterAsync. This is likely intentional as the PRD states counter resets on on-topic message, not on resolution."
