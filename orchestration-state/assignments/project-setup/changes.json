  "summary": "Implemented fixes for the project-setup assignment according to the microplan:\n\n1. **ProgressPath.csproj**: Updated LLMTornado package reference from version 1.0.0 (which doesn't exist) to version 3.8.46 (the latest stable version confirmed via NuGet API).\n\n2. **appsettings.json**: Added a `_ConfigurationNote` property at the top level documenting the environment variable mapping convention (double underscore notation like LLM__Provider maps to LLM:Provider), explaining how the PRD's SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE references map to .NET's nested configuration.\n\n3. **appsettings.Development.json**: \n   - Removed all placeholder secrets (passwords, API keys, client IDs/secrets)\n   - Set ConnectionString to use LocalDB reference for safer local development\n   - Set all secret fields to empty strings\n   - Added a `_ConfigurationNote` explaining to use dotnet user-secrets or environment variables for actual secrets\n\n4. **MainLayout.razor.css**: Removed the duplicate TODO comment with CSS variable definitions (lines 2-10) since these are already properly defined in wwwroot/css/app.css. Kept only the layout-specific styles.\n\nNote: Build verification could not be performed because dotnet CLI is not available in the current environment. The implementer should verify locally that the project builds successfully after package restoration.",
  "deviations": [
    "Used version 3.8.46 for LLMTornado package (the latest stable version as verified via NuGet API). The microplan suggested checking for version 4.x, but the actual latest version is 3.8.46.",
    "Could not verify the build compiles because dotnet CLI is not installed in this environment. The user should run 'dotnet build' locally to confirm the changes work correctly."
