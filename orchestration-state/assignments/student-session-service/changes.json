  "summary": "Implemented the Student Session Management Service for REQ-GROUP-014 through REQ-GROUP-024. Created IStudentSessionService interface with 6 methods: JoinGroupAsync, GetExistingSessionAsync, IsNicknameAvailableAsync, UpdateProgressAsync, UpdateLastActivityAsync, and GetGroupSessionsAsync. Implemented StudentSessionService with full functionality including: device binding validation, session restoration for returning devices, case-insensitive nickname uniqueness validation, progress tracking that only increases (per REQ-GOAL-011), automatic goal completion detection for both Binary and Percentage goals, and race condition handling via DbUpdateException for duplicate key violations. Created device.js for localStorage-based device ID management with UUID v4 generation (using crypto.randomUUID with manual fallback for older browsers). Registered StudentSessionService in Program.cs DI container. Build succeeded with 0 warnings and 0 errors.",
