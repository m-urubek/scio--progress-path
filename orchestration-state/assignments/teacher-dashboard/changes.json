  "summary": "Implemented the Real-Time Teacher Monitoring Dashboard (REQ-DASH-004 through REQ-DASH-017):\n\n1. **GroupDashboard.razor** - Main dashboard page at route /groups/{GroupId:int}:\n   - Authentication required with teacher ownership verification\n   - Displays group name, QR code toggle, and student list\n   - SignalR connection for real-time updates (ReceiveProgress, ReceiveAlert, AlertResolved, StudentResumedActivity, StudentJoined)\n   - Students with alerts sorted to top (REQ-DASH-009)\n   - Handles ~30 concurrent students efficiently with scrollable container\n\n2. **StudentRow.razor** - Displays individual student:\n   - Nickname and progress indicator (progress bar for Percentage, checkmark for Binary)\n   - Alert indicators with tooltips (yellow clock for Inactivity, red warning for Off-topic)\n   - \"Mark Resolved\" button for alerts (REQ-DASH-007)\n   - Expandable to show StudentDetail\n\n3. **StudentDetail.razor** - Inline expansion showing:\n   - Key messages that contributed to progress (ContributesToProgress=true, REQ-DASH-015)\n   - \"View Full Chat\" button linking to /groups/{GroupId}/students/{SessionId}/chat (REQ-DASH-016)\n\n4. **ToastContainer.razor** - Toast notifications:\n   - New alert toasts with pink border (REQ-DASH-013)\n   - Activity resumption toasts with teal border, auto-dismiss after 4 seconds (REQ-DASH-012, REQ-AI-017)\n\n5. **Supporting changes**:\n   - Added GetGroupByIdAsync to IGroupService and GroupService for secure group retrieval\n   - Added ToastMessage model class\n   - Added CSS styles for toasts, student list, alerts, and animations\n   - Added Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client package reference",
  "deviations": [
    "Added Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client package to ProgressPath.csproj - this NuGet package was required for HubConnection and was not present in the project",
    "Created ToastMessage.cs in Models folder instead of as a nested class in ToastContainer.razor - this follows better C# conventions and allows proper type resolution across components",
    "The 'View Full Chat' button navigates to /groups/{GroupId}/students/{SessionId}/chat - the full chat history page implementation would be handled by a separate assignment"
