  "reasoning": "The PRD is comprehensive and well-structured after 5 rounds of clarification. All major gaps have been addressed:\n\n**Resolved by Clarifications:**\n- AI progress evaluation criteria (Round 1: bias toward credit, partial understanding counts)\n- Off-topic classification edge cases (Round 1: bias toward on-topic, clear examples provided)\n- Student progress visibility detail level (Round 1: percentage only, no sub-task breakdown)\n- Goal correction after confirmation (Round 1: create new group, duplicate names allowed)\n- LLM API failure handling (Round 1: per-message error with retry capability)\n- Activity resumption notifications (Round 1: transient toast, 4 seconds)\n- Concurrent groups per teacher (Round 1: yes, single-group dashboard view)\n- Inactivity timer vs connection state (Round 1: runs continuously server-side)\n- QR code URL format (Round 1: {BaseUrl}/join/{JoinCode}, configurable base)\n- Goal description/step constraints (Round 1: ~500 chars, 2-10 steps as guidance)\n- Speech-to-text implementation (Round 2: browser-native Web Speech API)\n- Rate limiting (Round 2: explicitly out of scope)\n- Inactivity timer start (Round 3: at join time, explicitly specified in REQ-AI-013)\n- Full chat history access (Round 3: available for both in-progress and completed students)\n- Particles library (Round 3: tsparticles via JS interop)\n- Orphaned session handling (Round 3: visible indefinitely, no cleanup needed)\n- Conversation context strategy (Round 3: full history with ~50 message soft cap)\n- Device localStorage cleared behavior (Round 2: treated as new student, acceptable for prototype)\n- Chat input disable on completion (Round 4: immediate)\n- Dashboard alert visibility (Round 4: sort alerts to top, use toasts)\n- Key messages determination (Round 4: pre-computed during AI processing)\n- Percentage rounding (Round 4: round to nearest integer)\n- Step count enforcement (Round 4: AI guidance, not hard limit, auto-convert 1-step to binary)\n- Completed student visual distinction (Round 4: 100%/checkmark is sufficient)\n- Inactivity timeout configurability (Round 5: fixed at 10 minutes)\n- Key messages format (Round 5: task-solution pairs, student message + AI response)\n- Green border timing (Round 5: immediate with CSS transition)\n- Goal confirmation preview (Round 5: step descriptions required, percentage preview optional)\n- Session expiration (Round 5: none, sessions permanent)\n- Off-topic warning display (Round 5: visual indicator + brief text explanation)\n\n**PRD Completeness:**\n- Clear functional requirements covering all user flows (teacher auth, group creation, student join, chat, dashboard)\n- Well-defined goal types (binary vs percentage) with specific behavior\n- Detailed alert/notification system with escalation paths\n- Complete real-time update requirements via SignalR\n- Comprehensive theme specification with exact colors and referenced CSS source\n- Full deployment requirements matching the reference project pattern\n- Explicit out-of-scope list preventing scope creep\n\n**Technical Feasibility:**\n- Greenfield project with no existing codebase conflicts\n- TherapistTemplate CSS is fully accessible for exact style extraction\n- SuperSmashHoesV2 deployment scripts are available as a reference pattern\n- All specified libraries (Blazor Server, SignalR, SQL Server, LLMTornado, QRCoder, tsparticles, KaTeX/MathJax, Web Speech API) are standard, well-documented technologies\n\n**Minor Implementation Decisions (Not Requiring Clarification):**\n- Exact toast positioning (standard UX pattern)\n- CSS transition durations (implementation detail)\n- Database schema design (technical implementation)\n- Specific error message wording (can follow patterns in PRD)\n\nThe PRD provides sufficient detail for implementation. The remaining minor decisions are appropriately left to the implementer's judgment and don't affect the product's core functionality or user experience."
