  "reasoning": "The PRD is exceptionally comprehensive and well-structured. All three previous clarifications (unique nicknames, English-only assignments, and repeatable alerts after resolution) have been fully incorporated into the document as formal requirements (REQ-GROUP-011a, FC-003/REQ-CHAT-003, and REQ-AI-013/014/015 respectively).\n\nKey business areas are thoroughly covered:\n- **Scope boundaries** are explicitly defined with a 29-item \"Out of Scope\" list.\n- **Business rules** are codified in a summary table and as fixed configuration values (FC-001 through FC-005).\n- **User-facing behavior** is detailed with acceptance criteria for all major flows (auth, group creation, goal interpretation, chat, alerts, completion, reconnection, dashboard).\n- **Off-topic/inactivity warning cycles** are precisely specified including reset conditions, escalation rules, and post-resolution behavior.\n- **Goal completion behavior** is clear: chat disables, teacher retains full visibility.\n- **Edge cases** like multi-tab behavior, device rebinding, API failures during goal interpretation, and mixed on/off-topic messages are all explicitly addressed.\n\nMinor ambiguities exist (e.g., whether the teacher can visually distinguish off-topic vs. inactivity alert types, or whether unresolved alerts auto-clear on goal completion), but these are UX details an experienced developer can reasonably decide without stakeholder input. No significant business requirement gaps remain."
